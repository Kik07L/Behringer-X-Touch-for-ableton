# X-Touch Custom Script for Ableton Live 12

This repository contains a modified version of the MackieControl script, adapted specifically for Behringer X-Touch controllers. Originally developed by Arthur Montvidas and further enhanced by Robrecht & posted on github with the contribution of Kik07L, this version adds support for Ableton Live 12 with numerous improvements, including Extender functionality and colored scribble strips.

# We highly recommend downloading the Release version [here](https://github.com/Kik07L/Behringer-X-Touch-for-ableton/releases). The source code here may include untested or beta features that are potentially unstable.
For a stable experience, please use the latest Release. ðŸ˜„

## Features

### Colored Scribble Strips
- **Track Color Matching:** Scribble strip colors follow the track colors set in Ableton Live.
  - Hardware limited to 8 basic colors: black, red, yellow, green, blue, magenta, cyan, and white.
  - Automatically calculates the closest match.
- **Black Color Handling:** Black scribble strips are only used if explicitly selected in Live to prevent unreadable text.
- **Grayscale Handling:** All grayscale colors (except black) default to white scribble strips.
- **Inactive Channels:** Tracks beyond your active channels are marked with black scribble strips to indicate inactivity.
- **Plug-In Mode:**
  - Scribble strips are lit in a single color (Cyan) for better readability.
- **Alternative color matching method (beta):**
  - Attempts to improve color matching by prioritizing hue, to avoid light colors automatically mapping to white.
  - `SHIFT + DISPLAY`: Toggle between default (RGB distance-based) and alternative (hue-based) method. Setting is preserved across sessions.
  - `SHIFT + UP/DOWN`: Tune white cut-off for hue-based matching (higher = more colors map to white scribble strip).

### Level Meter Enhancements
- **Clipping Indicators:** Channel strip level meters now show clipping when it occurs.
- **Snappy Meters:** Channel strip level meters now react more quickly to changes in audio.

### Global Solo
- When one or more tracks are soloed, `SOLO` button in Transport Section toggles their solo state on and off simultaneously.

### Macro Mapper (beta)
- Quick access to 16 multi-mappable macros via the rotary encoders.
- Place the supplied "XTouch/Macro Mapper/X-Touch Macro Mapper" device on the Master track as the first (leftmost) device in the chain.
- Map the Max4Live devices in the rack to any function in the project and rename the 16 macro knobs to suit.
- Press and hold `USER` to bring up mappings on rotary encoders temporarily, or `SHIFT + USER` to lock.
  - Quick access through the `USER` button will work with any device that is first in the chain on the Master channel and has "X-Touch" in its name.

### Single Send Mode (beta)
- Default Sends mode (`SEND`) shows send levels for all return tracks/return chains on the current track/chain.
- New Single Send mode shows send levels for a single return track/return chain across all tracks/chains.
- In default Sends mode, either press `SEND` again or `SHIFT + Press rotary encoder` to select the corresponding return track for Single Send mode.
- Press `EQ` or `INST` to move control to the previous/next return track/return chain send levels.
- Scribble strips will turn black for unavailable sends (if the number of global return tracks differs from the number of return chains in a device with chains visible in the mixer).

### Device Control Lock (beta)
- With the rotary encoders assigned to device parameters (`PLUG-IN` > `Press rotary encoder` to select device), press `SHIFT + PLUG-IN` to lock current assignment.
- Device assignment will no longer be canceled by selecting, soloing, muting or arming other tracks.

### Night Mode (beta)
- Press all four `MODIFY` buttons (`SHIFT`, `OPTION`, `CONTROL` and `ALT`) simultaneously to toggle Night Mode.
- `MODIFY` section LEDs are permanently lit for enhanced visibility.
- Press any `MODIFY` button to temporarily light up all buttons.
- Night Mode setting is remembered across sessions.

### Chains behave as groups (beta)
- Press `SELECT` twice on a track that contains a Rack to expand its chains in the Mixer (same behaviour as with track groups).
- Rack chains react just like normal tracks to faders, `MUTE` and `SOLO` buttons and encoders (in Pan and Sends mode).
- Chain colors appear in scribble strips and can be modified just like track colors (press `TRACK` x5 for color mode).
- Note: if volume or panning for a device chain is macro mapped, the fader/rotary encoder for that chain will have no effect.
- Limitations: chains audio metering and audio routing are currently unavailable in Live's API.

### Feedback messages (beta)
- Short messages on Time Display provide feedback on various actions.

### Persistent settings (beta)
- Some global settings (Night Mode, show clock...) are now preserved across sessions.
- Settings are saved in options.txt.

### Optional features
- Select track by touching fader (off by default, can be enabled by editing options.txt).
- Indicate track muted via solo by flashing `MUTE` button LED (off by default, can be enabled by editing options.txt).
