# X-Touch Custom Script for Ableton Live 12

This repository contains a modified version of the MackieControl script, adapted specifically for Behringer X-Touch controllers. Originally developed by Arthur Montvidas and further enhanced by Robrecht & posted on github with the contribution of Kik07L, this version adds support for Ableton Live 12 with numerous improvements, including Extender functionality and colored scribble strips.

## Features

### Colored Scribble Strips
- **Track Color Matching:** Scribble strip colors follow the track colors set in Ableton Live.
  - Hardware limited to 8 basic colors: black, red, yellow, green, blue, magenta, cyan, and white.
  - Automatically calculates the closest match.
- **Black Color Handling:** Black scribble strips are only used if explicitly selected in Live to prevent unreadable text.
- **Grayscale Handling:** All grayscale colors (except black) default to white scribble strips.
- **Inactive Channels:** Tracks beyond your active channels are marked with black scribble strips to indicate inactivity.
- **Send/Plug-In Modes:**
  - Scribble strips are lit in a single color for better readability:
    - Yellow: Send mode.
    - Cyan: Plug-in mode.

### Level Meter Enhancements
- **Clipping Indicators:** Channel strip level meters now show clipping when it occurs.
- **Snappy Meters:** Channel strip level meters now react more quickly to changes in audio.
